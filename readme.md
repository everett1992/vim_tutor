## Need Finding

We created a web page that explains the advantages of using Vim over other text editors,
and how to think about Vim effectively.

We have a few friends who have expressed interest in learning to use Vim, but have had trouble learning.
Some people have given up, while others do use it but do not take advantage of it's full potential.
We talked with one friend in particular who has used Vim for nearly a year, but continues to enter
insert mode and use the editor like notepad. We designed the tutorial to reach both users unfamiliar with
Vim, and others who have not learned to use it effectively.

We asked our friend what confused him about Vim, and observed what features he neglected and chose to highlight them
in our tutorial. Rather than addressing specific issues we chose to instill the mindset of an effective Vim user.

## Design

We highlighted all keyboard commands in colors consistent with the colors we used to represent Vim's different modes.
We used slide shows and visual representations to demonstrate ideas.


## Heuristics

- Used consistent colors to represent different modes and their commands.
- The web page is written in standard HTML best practices, and should be usable to any user with a modern web browser.
  There is no reason for this web page to be inaccessible to any special access devices.
- We considered building some sort of interactive Vim emulator, but ultimately decided it was out of the scope of
  the project. As such, there is no feedback as there is no user interaction.
- We included links to other Vim resources so users can investigate further if the desire, and to add finality to the page.
- Again, there is no user input so there should be no errors.
- Users have no actions, so there is nothing to undo.
- Strictly speaking, the browser is in control of the web page, but there is so little to control that the internal locus
  may fall outside the bounds of this project.
- We're teaching people about Vim. Some mental effort will be required on their part.

## Usability Testing

We showed our tutorial to our friend and asked him his thoughts on what we talked about.
We went through a few revisions of the site emphasising different aspects of Vim until we
found a good mix of features and ideology. Afterwords we watched him work in Vim and saw him using
more advanced features than he was before. Hopefully this trend will continue.

## Team Contribution

[This was us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8qgehH3kEQ)

We generally switched on and off coding from the same computer. Nothing was done without both of us present.
The whole project was entirely collaborative.
